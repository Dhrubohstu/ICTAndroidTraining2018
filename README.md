# Android DEV training by ICT, 2018, HSTU.

## Getting Started with Android

### Class One - Intro to Android

First we need to install "Android Studio" according to setup our
development interface.

### Links:
 -[Andriod Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install)

```
	No need to install JDK. The latest version of android has builtin java envirionment
```


#### For the first run Android Studio will download SDK and AVD, that will take time.

After successful installation "Creat a new project" for first run gradle will be downloaded approximately 100mb will be needed.



```
	- Note: please "git pull" all the files to get latest ones. 
And I will try to upload every class and extra projects with kotlin. That's all for now.
```
